  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?

Your response goes here!

1. I have learned new elements and how to search for them as I need them using the MDN web docs
2. So far, the easy part has been memorizing the html template and the most commonly used elements.
3. The hard part has been formatting the document to be exactly like mockups, as it could get a bit tedious
to constantly look up which element does what, although eventually I will probably have memorized a few.
4. Well, when I built my website for school I did not know that the MDN web docs existed, so having that resource there
will definitely help me get the information I need to build websites exactly as I want them to look without
having to search the internet extensively for the simplest answer.
